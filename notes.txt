Each sector is its own file (dictionary or userdata).

Disk:
512 bytes per sector

Directory Sectors:
each file logged into the sector will POINT to the file and its respective sector.

initial variables:
4 bytes for back
4 bytes for forward
4 bytes for free
4 bytes for filler

for each file in each directory:
1 byte for file type.
9 bytes for the name.
4 byte for the link to the sector.
2 byte for the size.

31 x 16 + 16

If the contents exceed 496 bytes, we will have to utilize
another sector with the same format but with different back and forward values.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

UserData Sectors:
UserData content will be stored in blocks (504 bytes each).

4 bytes for backwards block sector num (on initialization -1)
4 bytes for forward block sector num (on initialization -1)
504 bytes for content.

If the contents exceed 504 bytes, we will have to utilize
another sector with the same format but with different back and forward values.
